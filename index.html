                <h1 class="title">History</h1>
                <p>
                    Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears, an English businessman who had earlier bought the
                    Stamford
                    Bridge athletics
                    stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground. His original idea was to rent
                    it to
                    an existing club,
                    but after a deal with Fulham FC was halted he got the idea to start a new club.
                </p>
                <h3>The biggest team in the capital</h3>
                <p>
                    The huge attendance numbers made "The Pensioners", a nickname for the team, to one of the
                    richest
                    clubs in the country
                    and made it possible to pay well reputed players. Chelsea become also home for the first
                    non-British
                    player in the
                    Football League, the Danish Nils Middelboe, who arrived to the club in 1913.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, the first five decades of the club's existence were not overly fruitful. The team would be
                    in
                    constant motion
                    between Division 1 and Division 2. In their second decade of existence, however, they managed to
                    reach the FA Cup final
                    for the first time.

                <h3>First league title</h3>
                <p>
                    Their first League title in 1955 was a shock for everyone, especially considering the club had
                    finished in the bottom
                    half of the league for most of the previous seasons. This unexpected success was not enough to
                    turn
                    their fortunes
                    around, however, and the club soon returned to mediocrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mid-60s caught Chelsea at the height of their popularity, with many big-name celebrities
                    becoming regular guests at
                    Stamford Bridge. For the first time in their history, the club was seen as an actual contender.
                    After securing their
                    first League Cup in 1965, they followed it up with two more "firsts" by claiming an FA Cup in
                    1970
                    and a Cup Winners'
                    Cup in 1971.
                </p>
                <h3>Debts and new ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    As it turned out, those were their last trophies for a while; with many financial difficulties
                    regarding the
                    redevelopment of Stamford Bridge and the increased hooliganism among the club's fans, Chelsea
                    soon
                    found themselves in a
                    precarious position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the next couple of decades, Chelsea's on-field results were not much of a priority, as
                    the
                    club's officials were
                    desperately fighting to avoid bankruptcy. The ownership of the Mears family was interrupted when
                    the
                    club was sold for
                    the symbolic sum of Â£1 to the new owner Ken Bates in 1982.
                </p>
                <h3>Return to the spotlight</h3>
                <p>
                    The club did not return to the spotlight until 1996 and the appointment of Ruud Gullit as
                    player-manager. With the
                    celebrated Dutchman at the helm and a strike force led by Italian internationals Gianluca Vialli
                    and
                    Gianfranco Zola,
                    Chelsea were once again one of the most exciting clubs in English football. While the club did
                    not
                    manage to go all the
                    way in the Premier League during this period, they did enjoy some Cup success with two FA Cup
                    victories in 1997 and 2000
                    and a League Cup triumph in 1998. To top it off, they also claimed their second Cup Winners' Cup
                    in
                    1998 by defeating
                    Stuttgart 1-0 in the final.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chelsea was at this period a team hugely dominated by foreign players. A game on Boxing Day 1999
                    marked a new era in
                    Brittish league football, when the Chelsea side against Southampton consisted of the first
                    "all-overseas XI". No British
                    player was starting the match; the players were: Ed De Goey (Holland), Albert Ferrer (Spain),
                    Frank
                    Lebouef (France),
                    Emerson Thome (Brazil), Dan Petrescu (Romania), Celestine Babayaro (Nigeria), Gus Poyet
                    (Uruguay),
                    Didier Deschamps
                    (France), Roberto Di Matteo (Italy), Gabriele Ambrosetti (Italy) and Tore Andre Flo (Norway).

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Eden Hazard scored two goals and made another to help Chelsea thump London rivals Arsenal in
                    Baku
                    and win the Europa
                    League.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victory gave Blues boss Maurizio Sarri the first trophy of his managerial career and ensured the
                    Gunners will miss out
                    on next season's Champions League.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With only about 5,000 fans from both sides able to make it to Azerbaijan, there was an eerie
                    atmosphere
                    at the Olympic
                    Stadium in Baku, which appeared less than half full.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was the surreal setting for a match played 2,500 miles away from both teams' home, and the
                    game
                    itself was devoid
                    of action before the break before bursting into life early in the second half.
                </p>
                <h3>Chelsea 3 - 0 Watford</h3>

                    <figcaption>David Luiz scored his third goal of the season to double Chelsea's lead shortly

                <p>
                    Chelsea secured their place in the Champions League next season with victory over Watford at
                    Stamford Bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The win, combined with Arsenal's draw against Brighton, means the Blues are guaranteed a
                    top-four
                    finish in the Premier
                    League.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a quiet first half, Chelsea scored twice within three minutes early in the second period
                    through headers by Ruben
                    Loftus-Cheek and David Luiz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gonzalo Higuain sealed the points with a neat finish from Pedro's pass for his fifth goal for
                    the club.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The win moves Chelsea up to third, one point ahead of Tottenham and four points clear of the
                    fifth-placed Gunners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FA Cup finalists Watford started brightly, going close through Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu,
                    but were left to rue
                    their slow start to the second half that saw Chelsea quickly take the game away from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hornets, who stay 10th, have now won just one of their past five Premier League games since
                    their FA Cup semi-final
                    victory over Wolves last month.
