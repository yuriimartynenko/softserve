                        <h1 class="title">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears, an English businessman who had earlier bought the
                            Stamford
                            Bridge athletics
                            stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground. His original idea was to
                            rent
                            it to
                            an existing club,
                            but after a deal with Fulham FC was halted he got the idea to start a new club.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The biggest team in the capital</h3>
                        <p>
                            The huge attendance numbers made "The Pensioners", a nickname for the team, to one of the
                            richest
                            clubs in the country
                            and made it possible to pay well reputed players. Chelsea become also home for the first
                            non-British
                            player in the
                            Football League, the Danish Nils Middelboe, who arrived to the club in 1913.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet, the first five decades of the club's existence were not overly fruitful. The team would
                            be
                            in
                            constant motion
                            between Division 1 and Division 2. In their second decade of existence, however, they
                            managed to
                            reach the FA Cup final
                            for the first time.

                        <h3>First league title</h3>
                        <p>
                            Their first League title in 1955 was a shock for everyone, especially considering the club
                            had
                            finished in the bottom
                            half of the league for most of the previous seasons. This unexpected success was not enough
                            to
                            turn
                            their fortunes
                            around, however, and the club soon returned to mediocrity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mid-60s caught Chelsea at the height of their popularity, with many big-name celebrities
                            becoming regular guests at
                            Stamford Bridge. For the first time in their history, the club was seen as an actual
                            contender.
                            After securing their
                            first League Cup in 1965, they followed it up with two more "firsts" by claiming an FA Cup
                            in
                            1970
                            and a Cup Winners'
                            Cup in 1971.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Debts and new ownership</h3>
                        <p>
                            As it turned out, those were their last trophies for a while; with many financial
                            difficulties
                            regarding the
                            redevelopment of Stamford Bridge and the increased hooliganism among the club's fans,
                            Chelsea
                            soon
                            found themselves in a
                            precarious position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the next couple of decades, Chelsea's on-field results were not much of a priority,
                            as
                            the
                            club's officials were
                            desperately fighting to avoid bankruptcy. The ownership of the Mears family was interrupted
                            when
                            the
                            club was sold for
                            the symbolic sum of Â£1 to the new owner Ken Bates in 1982.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Return to the spotlight</h3>
                        <p>
                            The club did not return to the spotlight until 1996 and the appointment of Ruud Gullit as
                            player-manager. With the
                            celebrated Dutchman at the helm and a strike force led by Italian internationals Gianluca
                            Vialli
                            and
                            Gianfranco Zola,
                            Chelsea were once again one of the most exciting clubs in English football. While the club
                            did
                            not
                            manage to go all the
                            way in the Premier League during this period, they did enjoy some Cup success with two FA
                            Cup
                            victories in 1997 and 2000
                            and a League Cup triumph in 1998. To top it off, they also claimed their second Cup Winners'
                            Cup
                            in
                            1998 by defeating
                            Stuttgart 1-0 in the final.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chelsea was at this period a team hugely dominated by foreign players. A game on Boxing Day
                            1999
                            marked a new era in
                            Brittish league football, when the Chelsea side against Southampton consisted of the first
                            "all-overseas XI". No British
                            player was starting the match; the players were: Ed De Goey (Holland), Albert Ferrer
                            (Spain),
                            Frank
                            Lebouef (France),
                            Emerson Thome (Brazil), Dan Petrescu (Romania), Celestine Babayaro (Nigeria), Gus Poyet
                            (Uruguay),
                            Didier Deschamps
                            (France), Roberto Di Matteo (Italy), Gabriele Ambrosetti (Italy) and Tore Andre Flo
                            (Norway).

                            Eden Hazard scored two goals and made another to help Chelsea thump London rivals Arsenal in
                            Baku
                            and win the Europa

                            Victory gave Blues boss Maurizio Sarri the first trophy of his managerial career and ensured
                            the
                            Gunners will miss out
                            on next season's Champions League.

                            With only about 5,000 fans from both sides able to make it to Azerbaijan, there was an eerie
                            atmosphere
                            at the Olympic
                            Stadium in Baku, which appeared less than half full.

                        <p>
                            That was the surreal setting for a match played 2,500 miles away from both teams' home, and
                            the
                            game
                            itself was devoid
                            of action before the break before bursting into life early in the second half.
